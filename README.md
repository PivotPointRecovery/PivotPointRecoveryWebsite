# Pivot Point Recovery — Public Website

The public marketing site for [pivotpointrecovery.org](https://pivotpointrecovery.org).

Plain static HTML + CSS + a little vanilla JS. No build step, no framework, no
dependencies. Open a file in a browser and it works.

This repo is **only** the public website. The staff portal, CRM, accounting,
and donation processing live in the separate `nonprofitportal` application.

## Design system

Defined as CSS custom properties at the top of `styles.css`.

- **Blue** `#005191` · **Navy** `#1a2b4a` · **Gold** `#ffb81c` (CTA accent)
- **Display font** Antonio (uppercase headings) · **Body font** Palanquin
- 1200px container, 12px radius

Reuse the existing classes rather than adding new ones where possible:
`page-hero`, `content-section`, `section-title`, `section-label`,
`involve-card`, `service-detail`, `split-section`, `check-list`, `cta-banner`,
`contact-form`, `form-group`, `btn btn-primary|btn-blue|btn-outline|btn-ghost`.

## Forms

Both public forms POST to the same Supabase edge function, which validates the
payload, writes it to the database with the service role, and emails staff via
Resend. The function answers preflight with an explicit origin allowlist —
`pivotpointrecovery.org`, `www.pivotpointrecovery.org`, any `*.pages.dev`
preview, and localhost — overridable with the `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` secret:

```
https://ihgwhglatsbhngbsezuj.supabase.co/functions/v1/public-forms
```

| Form | `form_type` | Table |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Contact | `contact` | `contact_submissions` |
| Volunteer | `volunteer` | `volunteer_interests` |

Both include an off-screen honeypot field (`_honeypot`); the function silently
accepts and drops any submission that fills it.

### Who receives the notification emails

Two sources, unioned — the `notification_recipients` table and the
`NOTIFICATION_EMAILS` secret. Adding a person is an insert, not a privileged
secret edit plus a redeploy:

```sql
insert into public.notification_recipients (email, label)
values ('steve@pivotpointrecovery.org', 'Steve');

-- Stop mailing someone without losing the record that they were on the list
update public.notification_recipients set active = false where email = '…';

-- Donations and enquiries can go to different people
update public.notification_recipients
   set receives_donations = false where email = '…';
```

The table is an addition, never a replacement: an empty table changes nothing,
and if it cannot be read at all, whoever the secret names is still mailed.
Matching is case-insensitive, so one person cannot appear twice and get every
notification twice.

`?health=1` reports a `recipients` **count** (never the addresses — the
endpoint is unauthenticated). That count is the number that matters: `notified:
true` never revealed that the list omitted someone, because from outside, one
recipient and five look identical. It is how the omission below went unnoticed.

> **Worth knowing:** for months the list did not include
> `erica@pivotpointrecovery.org` — the person asking where the notifications
> were. Nothing reported this, because a send to the addresses that *were*
> listed succeeds and returns `notified: true`.

The secret still works and is still read:

```sh
supabase secrets set RESEND_API_KEY="re_..." \
  NOTIFICATION_EMAILS="steve@pivotpointrecovery.org,info@pivotpointrecovery.org" \
  RESEND_FROM="Pivot Point Recovery <info@pivotpointrecovery.org>" \
  NOTIFICATION_PREFIX="PPR"
```

If either `RESEND_API_KEY` or `NOTIFICATION_EMAILS` is unset, the submission is
still saved to the database but **no email goes out**. The function returns
`{ ok: true, notified: false }` and logs the reason.

> **Half-fixed, and the remaining half is worse than it looks (2026-08-20).**
>
> The *sending* problem is genuinely gone. `pivotpointrecovery.org` is verified
> in Resend — DKIM (`resend._domainkey`) and the `send.` bounce subdomain both
> resolve — `RESEND_FROM` is on-domain, and the old
> `403 validation_error` is no longer returned. Live submissions come back
> `{"ok":true,"notified":true}`.
>
> **But the mail is not arriving.** Over three hours, across repeated live
> submissions, nothing from this sender reached
> `erica@pivotpointrecovery.org` — checked with `in:anywhere`, so spam and
> trash included — while Stripe, Supabase and other external mail to the same
> address arrived normally. The mailbox is fine; our mail is not getting to it.
>
> `notified: true` means *Resend accepted the API call*. It says nothing about
> delivery, which is exactly the blind spot that let this sit unnoticed.
>
> Two checks pinpoint which side is dropping it:
>
> 1. **[resend.com/emails](https://resend.com/emails)** — per-message status.
>    `delivered` vs `bounced` / `blocked` decides everything below.
> 2. **Google Admin → spam quarantine** (`admin.google.com`) — if Resend says
>    delivered, the message is being held before the mailbox.
>
> The likely cause, if it is the Google side: the notification is sent **from
> an address on `pivotpointrecovery.org` to recipients on
> `pivotpointrecovery.org`**, via an external provider. Google Workspace
> quarantines same-domain mail arriving from outside by default ("protect
> against spoofing of your domain"), and that rule is applied independently of
> SPF/DKIM/DMARC — all of which pass here (DKIM signs as the org domain, so
> alignment is fine under `p=quarantine`).
>
> If that is it, this affects **every staff recipient**, not one person —
> `steve@` and `info@` are on the same domain as the sender.
>
> Two ways out:
>
> - Allow the sender in Google Admin (Gmail → Spam, Phishing and Malware).
> - Or send from a **subdomain** — e.g. `no-reply@send.pivotpointrecovery.org`
>   — which sidesteps the same-domain heuristic entirely. That subdomain
>   already carries SPF and an SES MX; add it in Resend as a sending domain and
>   point `RESEND_FROM` at it.

Verify with:

```sh
# Config presence (booleans only, never values)
curl -s "https://ihgwhglatsbhngbsezuj.supabase.co/functions/v1/public-forms?health=1"

# A real submission
curl -s -X POST https://ihgwhglatsbhngbsezuj.supabase.co/functions/v1/public-forms \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' -H 'Origin: https://pivotpointrecovery.org' \
  -d '{"form_type":"volunteer","first_name":"Test","last_name":"Test","email":"you@example.com","phone":"5555550100"}'
```

`notified` must come back `true`.

## Donations

`donate.html` collects the amount and donor details, then POSTs to the site's
own checkout function — the same Supabase project as the forms:

```
POST https://ihgwhglatsbhngbsezuj.supabase.co/functions/v1/donations-checkout
  →  { url }  →  redirect to Stripe Checkout
```

It no longer posts to `/api/donations/checkout`. That route belonged to the
portal, stopped resolving when this site moved to standalone Cloudflare Pages,
and answered **405** — which is what left the donate page dead. Nothing but the
static site needs to be mounted on this host any more.

Card data never touches this site. Both functions run with `verify_jwt` off
because they are public endpoints; they authenticate by origin, honeypot, and
(for the webhook) Stripe's own signature.

| Function | Job |
| --- | --- |
| `donations-checkout` | Validates the gift, writes a `pending` row, opens a Stripe Checkout session |
| `donations-webhook` | Confirms the gift from Stripe, emails the donor a receipt and staff a notification |

### What the checkout function decides, not the browser

The amount in the request body is a suggestion. The function re-derives what is
chargeable: a **$5 floor** (below it card fees eat the gift) and a **$50,000
ceiling** (above it, a card is the wrong instrument — the donor is asked to get
in touch). `donate.html` enforces the same floor client-side so the donor is
told before a round trip; `MIN_GIFT` there and `MIN_CENTS` in the function have
to stay in step.

The `donations` row is written *before* Stripe is called, so every attempt is
attributable even if Stripe errors, and its id is used as the Stripe
idempotency key — a double-submitted form cannot double-charge. Stripe metadata
carries donor and fund fields only; no participant identifiers ever cross into
it.

### The webhook

Stripe posts to `donations-webhook`, which is subscribed to
`checkout.session.completed`, `checkout.session.async_payment_succeeded`,
`checkout.session.async_payment_failed`, `checkout.session.expired`,
`invoice.paid`, and `customer.subscription.deleted`.

Two independent defences, because money is on the line:

1. **Signature check** against `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET`, with a 5-minute
   timestamp tolerance and a constant-time compare.
2. **Re-fetch.** Every object is read back from the Stripe API before anything
   is written, so amounts and payment status come from Stripe rather than from
   the request body. If `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` is unset the function stays up
   in re-fetch-only mode and `?health=1` reports
   `"verification":"refetch_only"` — a forged event still cannot book a gift,
   because the amount is never taken from the payload. Set the secret anyway.

Redelivery is handled by a `stripe_events` table keyed on the Stripe event id,
so a replayed event returns `{"received":true,"duplicate":true}` and writes
nothing. Monthly renewals — the one donation with no checkout session behind it
— are keyed on the invoice id instead, which is what stops a redelivered
`invoice.paid` booking the same gift twice.

### Receipts

On a confirmed gift the webhook sends the donor a 501(c)(3) acknowledgement
(amount, date, fund, EIN 41-4331928, and the no-goods-or-services language the
IRS wants) and notifies staff separately. The two are tracked in different
columns — `receipt_sent_at` and `notified` — so if one send fails the retry
only repeats the half that failed, and no donor is thanked twice. Set
`DONOR_RECEIPTS=0` to suppress donor receipts and keep staff notifications.

## Backend

The backend now lives in this repo rather than only in the dashboard, so a
deploy is reproducible and reviewable:

```
supabase/
  config.toml
  migrations/            schema, applied in filename order
                         (incl. notification_recipients)
  functions/
    _shared/             http (CORS), db, env, validate, notify, stripe
    public-forms/        contact + volunteer
    donations-checkout/  opens Stripe Checkout
    donations-webhook/   confirms gifts, sends receipts
```

Deploy with the Supabase CLI:

```sh
supabase link --project-ref ihgwhglatsbhngbsezuj
supabase db push
supabase functions deploy public-forms      --no-verify-jwt
supabase functions deploy donations-checkout --no-verify-jwt
supabase functions deploy donations-webhook  --no-verify-jwt
```

`--no-verify-jwt` is required: these are public endpoints called by anonymous
visitors and by Stripe, neither of which carries a Supabase JWT.

### Secrets

Set on the Supabase project, not in this repo. `env.ts` resolves each through a
short alias list, so a name that is *close* still works — but check
`?health=1` rather than assuming, because a missed secret fails silently.

| Secret | Used by | Effect if unset |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `STRIPE_SECRET_KEY` | checkout, webhook | Checkout returns 502; no gift can be made |
| `STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` | webhook | Falls back to re-fetch-only verification |
| `RESEND_API_KEY` | all three | Rows save, no mail |
| `NOTIFICATION_EMAILS` | all three | Only the `notification_recipients` table is used; if that is empty too, staff are not told |
| `RESEND_FROM` | all three | Falls back to Resend's sandbox sender (403 to anyone but the account owner) |
| `SITE_URL` | checkout, webhook | Defaults to `https://pivotpointrecovery.org` |
| `DONOR_RECEIPTS` | webhook | Receipts on; set `0` to suppress |
| `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` | all three | Defaults to the production hosts + `*.pages.dev` + localhost |

Health-check every function at once:

```sh
for fn in public-forms donations-checkout donations-webhook; do
  echo -n "$fn: "
  curl -s "https://ihgwhglatsbhngbsezuj.supabase.co/functions/v1/$fn?health=1"; echo
done
```

`donations-checkout` also reports `"mode":"live"|"test"|"unset"`, so a test key
left in production is visible without exposing the key.

## Local development

No build step. Serve the directory over HTTP so root-relative paths resolve:

```sh
python3 -m http.server 8080
# then open http://localhost:8080
```

`/donate` works from `localhost` — the checkout function's CORS allowlist
covers localhost and `*.pages.dev` previews alongside the production hosts. Use
a [Stripe test card](https://docs.stripe.com/testing) rather than a real one,
and note the deployed function is on **live** keys, so a gift made from a local
page is a real charge.

## Deployment

Cloudflare Pages, served from the repository root. `_headers` sets the security
and CSP policy; extend the CSP there if you add a new external asset host.

> **Error 1000 outage: resolved (verified 2026-08-20).** `https://pivotpointrecovery.org/`
> and `/donate` both return `200`. The apex no longer resolves to Cloudflare's
> own anycast addresses.

`/portal` still needs to reach the portal application — the footer "PPR Login"
link depends on it. `/api/*` does **not**: the donate page now calls the
Supabase function directly, so nothing on this host has to proxy an API any
more.
